# ============================================
# YAML Practice: Basic Syntax Examples
# ============================================
# This file demonstrates fundamental YAML syntax patterns
# YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language"

# ---
# 1. BASIC KEY-VALUE PAIRS
# ---
# Simple key-value pairs (strings)
name: John Doe
age: 30
email: john.doe@example.com

# ---
# 2. DATA TYPES
# ---
# String (can be quoted or unquoted)
string_example: "Hello World"
string_unquoted: Hello World
string_with_special_chars: "Value with: colon & special chars"

# Number (integer)
integer_example: 42
negative_number: -10

# Number (float)
float_example: 3.14159
scientific_notation: 1.5e-3

# Boolean (true/false, yes/no, on/off)
boolean_true: true
boolean_false: false
boolean_yes: yes
boolean_no: no
boolean_on: on
boolean_off: off

# Null values (null, ~, empty)
null_value: null
null_alternative: ~
empty_value: ""

# ---
# 3. LISTS (SEQUENCES)
# ---
# List with dash notation (recommended)
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
  - grape

# List with inline notation
colors: [red, green, blue, yellow]

# List of numbers
numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Mixed list
mixed_list:
  - string
  - 42
  - true
  - null

# ---
# 4. DICTIONARIES (MAPPINGS)
# ---
# Simple nested dictionary
person:
  name: Jane Smith
  age: 28
  city: New York

# Inline dictionary notation
coordinates: {x: 10, y: 20, z: 30}

# ---
# 5. NESTED STRUCTURES
# ---
# Complex nested structure
company:
  name: Tech Corp
  founded: 2010
  employees:
    - name: Alice
      role: Developer
      skills:
        - Python
        - JavaScript
        - Docker
    - name: Bob
      role: Designer
      skills:
        - Photoshop
        - Figma
  locations:
    headquarters:
      city: San Francisco
      country: USA
    branches:
      - city: London
        country: UK
      - city: Tokyo
        country: Japan

# ---
# 6. MULTI-LINE STRINGS
# ---
# Literal block scalar (preserves newlines and indentation)
literal_block: |
  This is a multi-line string
  that preserves line breaks
  and indentation.
  
  Empty lines are also preserved.

# Folded block scalar (folds newlines into spaces)
folded_block: >
  This is a multi-line string
  that folds line breaks
  into spaces.
  Good for long paragraphs.

# ---
# 7. STRING ESCAPING
# ---
# Special characters
quoted_string: "String with \"quotes\" inside"
escaped_newline: "Line 1\nLine 2"
unicode_example: "Hello \u0041\u0042\u0043"

# ---
# 8. ANCHORS AND ALIASES (REFERENCES)
# ---
# Define an anchor (reference point)
defaults: &defaults
  timeout: 30
  retries: 3
  debug: false

# Use the anchor with alias
server_config:
  <<: *defaults  # Merge the defaults
  host: localhost
  port: 8080

# Another example
colors_base: &base_colors
  primary: blue
  secondary: green

theme:
  colors:
    <<: *base_colors
  name: "My Theme"

# ---
# 9. COMMENTS
# ---
# This is a comment
# Comments can appear anywhere in YAML
# They start with # and continue to end of line
value: "This line has a value"  # Inline comment

# ---
# 10. TAGS (EXPLICIT TYPES)
# ---
# Force specific types
string_number: !!str 12345      # String: "12345"
boolean_string: !!bool "true"   # Boolean: true
integer_string: !!int "42"      # Integer: 42

# ---
# 11. QUOTES USAGE
# ---
# Single quotes (no escaping except for single quotes)
single_quoted: 'This is a string with "quotes"'

# Double quotes (allows escaping)
double_quoted: "This is a string with \"quotes\""

# No quotes (when safe)
unquoted: This is fine for simple strings

# Quotes needed for special cases
needs_quotes: "Value with: colon"
also_needs_quotes: "true"  # To prevent being interpreted as boolean
